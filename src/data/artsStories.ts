      <h2>Art from Adversity</h2>
      <p>Vijay Kumar was 13 when his family lost everything in a devastating flood. Beyond their material possessions, the disaster claimed his younger sister – a trauma that left Vijay withdrawn and uncommunicative. Relocated to a rehabilitation colony in Jalna, he stopped attending school and spent days staring silently at the walls of their temporary shelter. Concerned neighbors connected the family with ASC's trauma support program for disaster-affected children.</p>

      <h2>Finding Expression</h2>
      <p>In the ASC program, traditional therapy was combined with expressive arts – giving children who couldn't verbalize their experiences other channels for expression. Initially reluctant, Vijay was encouraged to try different art forms without pressure or expectations. It was during a painting session that something shifted – provided with colors and canvas, Vijay began creating striking, emotionally powerful images that communicated his grief, anger, and eventually, hope.</p>

      <h2>Talent Recognized</h2>
      <p>Vijay's art teacher, a professional artist volunteering with ASC, immediately recognized his extraordinary talent. "His technique was completely untrained, but his emotional expression and composition showed remarkable intuitive understanding," she recalls. With encouragement, Vijay gradually increased his engagement with the program, eventually returning to school while continuing to develop his artistic skills through ASC's extended arts program.</p>

      <h2>From Healing to Advocacy</h2>
      <p>As Vijay's healing progressed, his artwork evolved. He began creating pieces that addressed broader social issues – environmental degradation, rural poverty, and resilience in the face of hardship. At 17, his series "After the Waters Receded," depicting communities rebuilding after floods, was exhibited in a prominent state gallery. The exhibition generated both critical acclaim and public awareness about disaster preparedness in vulnerable communities.</p>

      <h2>New Horizons</h2>
      <p>Today, at 20, Vijay studies at a prestigious art institute on a full scholarship. His work has been featured in national exhibitions, with several pieces acquired by collectors and museums. While his success has improved his family's financial situation, Vijay's most significant achievement may be the art program he established in his old rehabilitation colony. Every Saturday, he returns to teach art to children facing circumstances similar to his past struggles.</p>

      <p>"Art gave me a voice when I had no words," Vijay explains. "It became a bridge back to life when I felt disconnected from everything. I want other children to know that even in the darkest times, there are colors waiting to be discovered."</p>
