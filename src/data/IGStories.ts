      <h2>Seeds of Entrepreneurship</h2>
      <p>Meena and Reena Sharma were 16-year-old daughters of a marginal farmer when they joined ASC's youth program. Their family's small landholding barely provided subsistence, and like many girls in their village, their educational prospects seemed limited. But the twins shared an unusual talent – they had learned traditional embroidery and fabric crafts from their grandmother, creating intricate designs that stood out for their quality and creativity.</p>

      <h2>Opportunity Through Education</h2>
      <p>When ASC introduced their rural entrepreneurship program, focusing on identifying local skills with market potential, the twins' craftsmanship caught their instructor's attention. Through the program, they learned business fundamentals: pricing, quality control, market research, and sustainable production. Most importantly, they were introduced to the concept of upcycling – creating beautiful products from fabric waste that would otherwise be discarded.</p>

      <h2>Building a Business</h2>
      <p>With a small seed grant of ₹15,000 from ASC's youth enterprise fund, the Sharma twins launched "Earth Threads" – a sustainable crafts business that transformed fabric scraps from nearby textile factories into decorative items, bags, and household accessories. Their initial products, sold at local markets, quickly gained popularity for their unique designs and environmental message. Within a year, they had repaid their seed grant and expanded their workshop.</p>

      <h2>Growing Impact</h2>
      <p>Today, at 22, the Sharma twins lead a thriving social enterprise that employs 15 women from their village, most of whom are mothers who can now contribute to their families' income while working flexible hours. The business has established partnerships with three retail chains that specialize in sustainable products, and their online store ships handcrafted items across the country. Their annual revenue has grown to ₹18 lakhs, with consistent profitability.</p>

      <h2>Giving Back</h2>
      <p>Perhaps most remarkably, Meena and Reena have established the "Earth Threads Education Fund," which allocates 10% of their profits to provide school supplies for children in their village. Last year, the fund supported 120 students with notebooks, textbooks, and school bags. "We remember what it was like to worry about affording basic school supplies," Meena explains. "Success means nothing if we can't help lift others as we rise."</p>
